# Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis

## Objective
Analyze retail sales data to identify performance trends and profitability by month and by category.

## Files (Day 1–3)
- `Retail_Sales.csv` → Dataset (sampled Jan–Mar 2024)
- `retail_analysis.sql` → SQL queries:
  - Monthly Sales Trend
  - Profit by Category
  - Top Selling Products

## Next (Day 4–6)
- Run SQL queries in SQLite / PostgreSQL / MySQL and export results to `SQL_Results.csv`.
- Start Python analysis & visualizations.

## Notes
- Dates are in ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `Price` is unit price; total sales in SQL uses `Quantity * Price`.
