# HR Analytics - Predict Employee Attrition

## Objective
Analyze HR data to find factors related to employee attrition (who leaves vs who stays).

## Files (Day 1–3)
- `HR_Employee.csv` → Dataset (100 employees)
- `hr_attrition.sql` → SQL queries:
  - Attrition rate by department
  - Average income vs attrition
  - Attrition by years at company

## Next (Day 4–6)
- Run SQL queries and export results to `SQL_Results.csv`.
- Begin Python analysis & create first two visuals.
